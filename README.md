# myfirstplaybook

This Ansible playbook template is designed to perform a simple ping action on target hosts to verify their connectivity. The playbook can be useful for testing and validating the reachability of hosts in your environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

1. Ansible (version 2.9 or higher)
2. Git (for version control and collaboration)

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ansible-ping-playbook.git
cd ansible-ping-playbook
```

## Inventory File

Update the `hosts` file with the list of hosts you want to ping. You can group the hosts based on their purpose or environment. For example:

```csharp
[webservers]
web1.example.com
web2.example.com

[databases]
db1.example.com
db2.example.com
```

## Running the Playbook

To run the playbook, execute the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts ping.yml
```

This will run the ping.yml playbook using the hosts specified in the `hosts` file.
